README

If you just want to do a full cross-build, then you need to run the
./setup-target-build-environment script found in this folder first to set up
your build environment; then, just "make". The default target builds
"bin/stage-lights-1.0_armhf.deb"; copy that to the target platform, install
it, and it should just go.

There should not be any extra runtime dependencies not already on the BBB,
but if you encounter problems with this and you cannot figure out which
packages are needed we can give you a shortlist of likely candidates so
please let us know.

It's best if the BBB is connected to the network during installation so npm
setup can fetch dependencies.



You need to install some extra packages to do local development on Ubuntu
14.04 (trusty):

sudo apt-get install libgles2-mesa-dev
sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev
sudo apt-get install libglfw-dev

sudo apt-get install libjson0 libjson0-dev

When working on the nodeserver, you need to "npm install" to get
dependencies of the code installed alongside.

Then, to launch the server:

node server.js <path to config file>
