Test plan

-sending a reboot command, the application is up and responding to commands within x seconds
-simulated crash of the system, the application comes back up within x seconds
-for a given set of mp3/wav files
  -the application processes the entire file without crashing
   (if possible, we should try to process audio files faster than realtime in order to do rapid regression testing)
 -during periods of nonzero volume (or greater than a set threshold), there should be some output to the lights within x ms
 -manually check that the lights react in an expected way
   (checking for more complex behaviour should be done manually, for simplicity and so we can change the behaviour at any time)
